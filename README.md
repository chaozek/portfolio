# Portfolio

This is my summary of work done in 10 weeks in ITAbsolvent training. For layout I've used combination of pure css & reactstrap. I wanted clean visual which I think was achieved.

## PrevState Counter

Link [PrevState Counter](https://pavelkaplan.eu/third).  
Very simple app where I've learn about importance of prevState in react.
Class based component & Typescript & styled components is used in this project

## JS History

Link [JS History](https://pavelkaplan.eu/second).  
Historically first homework of ITA. There is not much going on.
This app was lately upgraded to TS & styled components.

## Hacker Typer

Link [Hacker Typer](https://pavelkaplan.eu/hackertyper).  
This is a bit more advanced app under the hood than previos ones. There is combination of lifecycle methods:

- componentDidMount
- componentWillUnmount
- componentDidUpdate

Animation of cursor was made by styled components animation.

## Tic-Tac-Toe

Complex app, logic was inspirated by this [project](https://github.com/Cristi-Rusu/Tic-Tac-Toe-10x10/tree/master/src/components/game).

## Chuck Norris Joke generator

Link [Chuck Norris Joke generator](https://pavelkaplan.eu/chuck).  
I've learned alot about asynchronous javascript. For fetching I've used async, await function. Duplicated jokes are deleted while fetching by simple JS fn.

## Redux

Link [Redux](https://pavelkaplan.eu/redux).  
In this App I've take a look under the hood of Redux. This is my first app in Redux, there was no need for me to use this technology, I've always used context API, which was completely fine for my project. I've no problem to dive deeper into Redux and learn how to use it on bigger projects.

## To Do

Link [To Do](https://pavelkaplan.eu/todo).  
This App can Update, Delete, Check, Add. I've plan for connecting this app with backend (express, mongodb) and save data permanently. I've done more apps like this before. I love how express is making everything clear and easier to use node.js.

## Blog

Link [Blog](https://pavelkaplan.eu/blog).  
LocalStorage & dynamic routing & custom hook (useLocalStorage) was used in this app. In the future as I'll have a minute I want to make this app CRUD, also connected with backend.
